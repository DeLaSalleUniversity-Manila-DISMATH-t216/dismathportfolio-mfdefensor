# Week 1
After the introductions, we had the discussion about propositional logics. The logic was defined.

# Week 2
The logic gates and their corresponding Truth Table values were discussed. The OR, AND, NOR, and XOR

# Week 3
The formal verification is proving arguments. It can be software or hardware. There are six formal verification methods. 3 of them were discussed this week: Direct Proof, Proof by Contraposition, Vacuous and Trivial Proof.
Direct proof is proving conditional statement by assuming the condition (first statement) to be true, and showing that the result (second statement) is also true by using the first statement. Proof by contraposition is proving a conditional statement by contrapositive structure--that is to say, the statements are interchanged--which means, the condition becomes the conclusion, and the conclusion becomes a condition--and each of them are negated, and like direct proof, the first statement (which is then the conclusion turned condition) is assumed true, and the second statement (the condition turned conclusion) should be shown as true using the first statement. The vacuous and trivial proof came from implication. Vacuous proof must show that the condition is false so that the conditional statement must be true. On the other hand, trivial proof shows that the conclusion is true so that the conditional statement must also be true. So far, my favorite of the methods is the direct proof, and I find the vacuous proof quite confusing.
